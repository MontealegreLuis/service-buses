# Service buses

[![CI workflow](https://github.com/montealegreluis/service-buses/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/montealegreluis/service-buses/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This Maven package provides buses for commands and queries as defined by CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation)

In CQRS, services are split into two separate types, a read side (Command) and a write side (Query). Commands change information and Queries return information.
